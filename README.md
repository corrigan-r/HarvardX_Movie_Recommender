This project was the main deliverable for the HarvardX Capstone on machine learning, the final course of the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate Program. The challenge of the Capstone project is to create a movie selection system using the MovieLens dataset. The [code](code.R), [R markdown file](Movie-Recommender.Rmd), and [pdf output](Movie-Recommender.pdf) are included in the repository. The [R markdown file](Movie-Recommender.Rmd) can be knit by first running the  [code](code.R), which will save several objects to the workspace, and then knitting the R markdown file.
